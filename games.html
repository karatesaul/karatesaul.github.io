                    A combination match-three puzzle with turn-based combat; match tokens in the puzzle to queue up
                    moves for the character to execute. Fight off bikers, beach bums, or ravers as you drunkenly stumble
                    around one of three differently themed bars.

                    Half/Way is a competitive multiplayer series of minigames in development for tablets. We started as
                    a class project for Game Design Practicum, and continued on our own time afterwards for the purposes
                    of submitting to IGF.  Still a work in progress, we originally developed in C# XNA, but moved to
                    Unity.

                    Zombeo is an epic battle between the zombies and the vaccinated humans for the fate of mankind! It
                    is a social game on the Sifteo cubes made in under 48 hours for the Sifteo Game Jam at University of California: Santa Cruz. My team of 3 and I won Best Use of the Sifteo Cubes for our innovative
                    design idea to use the cubes as ID tags for the players.
